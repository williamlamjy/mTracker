## Overview
I was involved in the development of a greenfield project known as `mTracker`. The `mTracker` program
serves as a command-line trading journal interface that allows busy individuals to store important financial instrument.
Throughout the project development, my main responsibilities include:
* Implementing and handling bugs relenting to `Etf` instrument and adding it.
* Implementing and handling bugs relenting to `Edit` features.

**Enhancements**:
* **New Feature:** Provided the add `etf` into watchlist functionality.
* implemented the `add etf` functionality to allow users to
  store crypto information into `mTracker`.
* Justification: This feature is one of the core features given that `crypto` is a widely known instrument type in
  the financial markets and is something our user would require support for.
* **New Feature:** Provided the `edit` functionality.
* The `edit` functionality allows the user to edit a current instrument parameters
* Justification: This is a core feature that allow users to edit current instruments they added. This allows for updates of parameters on the instruments.
    * Highlights: The `edit` functionality is required to interact with all instrument type and require requesting of inputs from user.
